y(t) = h(t)*x(t)
Figure out transfer function -> y(t) = h(t)*(h^-1(t)*x(t))

Pulse wrapping
	Requires calibrated frequency without distortions
	Replace flux offset with pulse, varying dt step -> function
	What happens if there is some time evolution of the qubit? Would this kind of msmt need to be done often or is the transfer function more or less constant?
	
Cryoscope
	FIR filter - what is?
	
TLS defects
	Some debate what they are.
	Modeled by 2 level potential well
	TLSs close in frequency steal excitation from QB
	
Quasiparticles
	Pulse sequence to figure out parity of qb
	Random telgraphic switching -> Lorentzian shape
	Switching rate seems to randomly vary by factor 4-5 on the scale of hours
	
Purcell effect
	Limits design by limiting coupling b/w qb and resonator
	qb decay is frequency de√•endent due to Purcell, TLS and quasiparticles
	TLS and QP dominate Purcell effect, Purcell basically negligible
	Purcell dominates at SMALL detunings
	Calibration needed at each bias

FIR potentially not stable, didn't present as a problem. Can be modeled.
SQUID redesign? Tighter loops maybe? Don't know if it would have a measurable effect.
